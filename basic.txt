Data Science is a field that attempts to find 
patterms and drae insights from data 

  Types of Machine Learning 
  Supervised Learning : uses labeled inputs (meaning has corresponding 
  input has corresponding output label) to train
  models and learn outputs

  unsupervised learnig: uses unlabeled data to learn
    patterns and structures from data
    Reinforcement Learning: uses a system of rewards
    and punishments to train models to make sequences
    of decisions
    agent learning in interactive environment 
    based on rewards and penalities
